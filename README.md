# RUM Distiller

RUM Distiller is a JavaScript library for data exploration of Adobe RUM data. It allows you to define the shape of the data first, in
the form of "series", "groups", and "facets". You can then filter the data based on the defined facets, and will automatically get data
aggregations for the series.
